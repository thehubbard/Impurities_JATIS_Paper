# Impurities simulation files
The following files can be used with Geant4 to reproduce data from M.W.J Hubbard et. al, "Impact of impurities in shielding material on simulations of instrument background in space", 
*Journal of Astronomical Telescopes, Instruments, and Systems*, 2023

## GDML
These contain the Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML) files that describe the geometry and materials used within the simulation.

## Physics List
Simulations used the `G4EmStandardPhysics_SpacePhysics` this is available upon request from the AREMBES (ATHENA Radiation Environment Models and X-Ray Background Effects Simulators) program. Further information regarding the physics list is described in *[A “space dedicated” physics list from the AREMBES project](https://indico.esa.int/event/160/contributions/1136/)*
